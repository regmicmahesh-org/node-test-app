# Node Test Application

I've made this NodeJS testing application in order to check my request
headers and basic web functionalities.

## Installing and Running the Application

```
git clone https://github.com/regmicmahesh-org/node-test-app
cd node-test-app
npm install
node src/app.js
```

## Endpoints

- / => index.html
- /headers => print all request headers
- /add => add a new number in list
- /view => view all numbers in list
